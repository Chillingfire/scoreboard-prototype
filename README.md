# Scoreboard Prototype

<b><i>Learning Purpose of this Project:</b> To create an online sports scoreboard prototype using React web development, as well as utilizing a backend database to store information about multiple games.</i>

<b><i>This project is currently in development.</b></i> 

It involves both an updatable sports scoreboard and a backend database. The scoreboard is created using the React library and is viewable on the internet. One user can be designated to update the information presented on the scoreboard, so that other users can see those updates. A database will be utilized to store multiple games so they can be retrieved by other users.
